# AMATH 482 reports
UW Course - AMATH 482: Computational Methods For Data Analysis. Taught by Craig Gin.  
The five assignments (reports) respectively explore the following topics:
1. Fourier Transform  
Apply FFT, noise filtering and averaging to solve an ultrasound tracking problem.
2. Gábor Transforms  
Explore the concept of Gábor transforms, and apply different windows/filters to produce spectrograms of music notes.
3. Principal Component Analysis  
Practice with SVD and PCA on multiple videos to track the path of a bucket. 
4. Machine Learning  
Based on the knowledge we have learnt, use wavelet transforms, SVD, PCA, and LDA (linear discriminant analysis) to do music genre analysis. Music resources obtained from the free music sharing website [Free Music Archive](https://freemusicarchive.org/static).
5. Neural Networks  
Explore and practice on the neural networks and convolutional neural network (CNN). We use tensorflow.keras in Python to build our classifiers.
